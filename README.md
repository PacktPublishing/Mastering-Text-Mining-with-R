# Mastering Text Mining with R
This is the code repository for [Mastering Text Mining with R](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-text-mining-r?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781783551811), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. Codes are available for chapter 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7. For example, Chapter 2.

The code will look like the following:

     library(prob)
     S <- rolldie(2, makespace = TRUE)
     A <- subset(S, X1 + X2 >= 8)
     B <- subset(S, X1 == 3) #Given
     Prob(A, given = B)
